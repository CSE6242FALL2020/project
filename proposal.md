##### What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.



##### How is it done today; what are the limits of current practice?



##### What's new in your approach? Why will it be successful?



##### Who cares?



##### If you're successful, what difference and impact will it make, and how do you measure them (e.g., via user studies, experiments, ground truth data, etc.)?



##### What are the risks and payoffs?



##### How much will it cost?



##### How long will it take?



##### What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success? How will progress be measured?
